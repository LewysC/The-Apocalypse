To fire code on the enablastion and disabaltion of the plugin, you need to create 
two voids in your main class. One called onEnable and one called onDisable. Everything 
inside of onEnable will be fired when the plugin is ran by the config and everything 
inside of ondisable will fire when the console disbales the plugin.

public class Main extends JavaPlugin {
-	
        //Declaration of variables. One sets what console we will be using the other
        //gets the plugin.yml file for the plugin.
    
-	  public Logger l= getLogger();
-	  PluginDescriptionFile p = getDescription();
-	
        //Using the void onEnable to write to the config to say that the plugin has been 
        enabled. (Be carful with caps when using this void).
    
-	  public void onEnable(){
-		  l.info("This code has fired on enable of the plugin.");
-	  }
-	
-	      //Using the void onEnable to write to the config to say that the plugin has been 
        disabled. (Be carful with caps when using this void).
    
-	  public void onDisable(){
-		  l.info("This code has fired on disable of the plugin.");
-	  }
-}
