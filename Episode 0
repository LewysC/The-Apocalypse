Examples of onEnable and onDisable commands using the logger as an example. This code will write to the config on the 
enable and disable of the plugin. 

public class Main extends JavaPlugin {
	
	public Logger l= getLogger();
	PluginDescriptionFile p = getDescription();
	
	public void onEnable(){
		l.info("This code has fired on enable of the plugin.");
	}
	
	
	public void onDisable(){
		l.info("This code has fired on disable of the plugin.");
	}
}
